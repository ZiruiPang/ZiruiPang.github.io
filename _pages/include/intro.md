I am currently a research assistant at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) campus (HKUST-GZ), under the supervision of <a href='https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/jiahengwei'>Jiaheng Wei (魏嘉珩)</a> and <a href='https://zixinzh.github.io/homepage'>Zixin Zhong (钟梓昕)</a>. I am also a first-year PhD student (from Spring 2026) at HKUST-GZ, within the DSA Thrust, Info Hub.

My current research interests revolve around:

1. **Noisy Labels**: Investigating methods to identify noisy labels (incorrect or missing labels) in various datasets, including images, text, and audio.
2. **LLM Unlearning**: Exploring techniques that enable large language models to selectively “forget” specific learned information.
3. **Reinforcement Learning Applications**: Studying the application of reinforcement learning in control problems and large-model fine-tuning.
4. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Exploring multi-agent systems composed of large language models and their applications in complex task settings.

I have a deep passion for music and enjoy the pleasure it brings me in my leisure time. I previously had a long-term collaboration with the <a href='https://space.bilibili.com/1645566770?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0'>Choir of Central University of Finance and Economics</a>.
