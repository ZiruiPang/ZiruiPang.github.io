I am currently a research assistant at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) campus (HKUST-GZ), under the supervision of <a href='https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/jiahengwei'>Jiaheng Wei (魏嘉珩)</a> and <a href='https://zixinzh.github.io/homepage'>Zixin Zhong (钟梓昕)</a> . At the same time, I am a master's student at UIUC, currently pursuing my Master of Science degree while doing an internship. My graduate coursework focuses on Data Science and Finance.

My current research interests revolve around:  

1. **Noisy Labels**: Investigating methods to identify noisy labels (incorrect or missing labels) in various datasets (images, text, audio).  
2. **LLM Unlearning**: Exploring techniques to make large language models "forget" certain learned information.
3. **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:** I explore new approaches in MARL, particularly its applications in robot pathfinding problems.


Beyond these research endeavors, I am also exploring the potential of integrating LLM technology with the financial sector.

During my studies at UIUC, I was a researcher at the <a href='https://asrm.illinois.edu/illinois-risk-lab/illinois-risk-lab-home'>Irisk Lab</a>, where I participated in and led a project that used machine learning models to help businesses assess risks.

I have a deep passion for music and enjoy the pleasure it brings me in my leisure time. I previously had a long-term collaboration with the <a href='https://space.bilibili.com/1645566770?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0'>Choir of Central University of Finance and Economics</a>.
